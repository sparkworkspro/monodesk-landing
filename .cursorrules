# MonoDesk Landing Page - Project Rules

## CSS Architecture

- **Each HTML page must have its own unique CSS file** - do not share stylesheets between pages
- CSS files should be named to match their HTML page (e.g., `bundle.html` → `css/bundle.css`)
- This allows each landing page variant to be fully independent and easily customizable

## Assets

- Assets in the `/assets` folder can be shared across all pages
- Common assets include logos, icons, and images

## File Structure

```
monodesk-landing/
├── index.html          → css/styles.css
├── vibes.html          → css/styles.css (legacy, can be split)
├── bundle.html         → css/bundle.css
├── css/
│   ├── styles.css      # For index.html and vibes.html
│   └── bundle.css      # For bundle.html
└── assets/             # Shared assets
    └── logo-lockup.svg
```

## When Creating New Pages

1. Create the HTML file in the root directory
2. Create a corresponding CSS file in `/css` with the same name
3. Link only that CSS file in the HTML `<head>`
4. Reuse assets from `/assets` as needed
